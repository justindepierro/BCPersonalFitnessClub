Enhancement sweep: 30 improvements across features, UX, architecture, reliability

P1 - High Value
- Debounce roster search input (250ms) to avoid DOM thrash on every keystroke
- Escape all HTML in Testing Week Plan and Testing Log location fields (XSS)
- Chart.js CDN fallback: graceful degradation if Chart.js fails to load
- JSON export now includes testing_log, testing_week_plan, constants, meta
- Fix exportDate showing "N/A": also check raw.exportDate fallback
- Position filter dropdown refreshes after data changes (new positions appear)
- Replace all alert() calls with showToast() for non-blocking feedback
- rebuildFromStorage autosave now uses lazy tab rendering

P2 - Nice to Have
- Leaderboard tab: added position and group filter dropdowns
- Sprint table rows now clickable (navigate to athlete profile)
- Error toasts persist 6s (vs 3.2s) with manual dismiss X button
- Extracted reusable fmtHeight() helper (replaces 3 inline calculations)
- sortedAthletes() helper eliminates 5 duplicate sort expressions
- tierLabelFromAvg() deduplicates tier label resolution from group dashboard
- Untested athletes shown with dimmed row + "Untested" badge in overview
- Import validation: warns on missing id/name, duplicate IDs before import
- Sort via DocumentFragment for single DOM reflow
- URL.revokeObjectURL delayed 10s to prevent premature download cancellation
- data-sort-value attribute on grade cells for type-safe sorting
- Print CSS: hide UI chrome, scale tables/charts for paper

P3 - Polish
- Scroll-to-top floating button (appears after 400px scroll)
- Chart instances destroyed on tab switch to free GPU memory
- selectAthlete() validates athlete exists, scrolls to top on profile switch
- Keyboard Esc hint shown in edit panel header
- Stale row guard: shows toast if clicked athlete was deleted
